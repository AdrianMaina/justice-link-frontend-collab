Follow the official Google Cloud OAuth guide to create your Client ID.

During setup, ensure you add the following Authorized JavaScript origin:http://localhost:5173

Then, open the file: src/main.jsx

Replace the placeholder with your actual Google Client ID: eg const GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = "YOUR_ACTUAL_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com";

## Running The frontend server

To start the Vite development server, run:
npm run dev

Your React application will be available at:
http://localhost:5173
Note: The frontend expects the backend API to be running at http://127.0.0.1:5000. Please ensure the backend server is running before launching the frontend.
